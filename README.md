# First Project - Data Analysis in Bootcamp neuefische

## Tasks
This project is centered around exploratory data 
analysis (EDA) techniques and statistical analysis, 
as well as modeling data using linear regression.

The tasks are given in 'EDA-Project_information.pdf'.

## EDA

File 'project1_eda.ipynb' contains:
* Analysis of features
	* given features
	* data types
	* number of missing values
	* removal of outliers
* EDA for every single value
* EDA for features in relation to price

## Model

File 'project1_model.ipynb' contains:
* calculation of R2 in relation to price
	* for continuous data
	* for categorical data (as dummies)
* model building
* model fit with different features
* model fit without outliers (determined via std)
* test of model using two linear Regressions
